Here's some stuff I've done.

* My <a href="https://github.com/brendanmapes/brendanmapes.github.io/blob/976af98db52c8023cbc9bea254705973eaf6489c/docs/_pdfs/thesis.pdf">thesis</a> for the QMSS master's program at Columbia University, where I studied data science (mostly). There are some obvious mistakes, outlined by my advisor <a href="https://github.com/brendanmapes/brendanmapes.github.io/blob/a6dde11913c666319c79f4c571be37df3c0e736e/docs/_pdfs/comments%20(1).pdf">here</a>. One of these days I'll update accordingly and repost.
