Here's some stuff I've done.

* My <a href="https://github.com/brendanmapes/brendanmapes.github.io/blob/976af98db52c8023cbc9bea254705973eaf6489c/docs/_pdfs/thesis.pdf">thesis</a> for the QMSS master's program at Columbia University, where I studied data science (mostly). There are some obvious mistakes, outlined by my advisor <a href="https://github.com/brendanmapes/brendanmapes.github.io/blob/a6dde11913c666319c79f4c571be37df3c0e736e/docs/_pdfs/comments%20(1).pdf">here</a>. One of these days I'll update accordingly and repost. 
* An <a href="https://www.communitiesspeakproject.com/boroughs">interactive map visualization</a> (that renders rather slowly) of issues facing New Yorkers that were surveyed by a research team I worked with during my time at Columbia, called Communties Speak. The majority of my work for this project was either data engineering or analysis, managing survey data intake through analysis and reporting. Often my preferences for reporting on our data were overruled by our PI (understandably so). Occasionally that led to confusing graphics like this one, where a gradient color palette was used for discrete, categorical variablesðŸ¤¢.
* A <a href="https://pypi.org/project/littlesis/">Python package</a> to interact with the database on LittleSis.org, which aims to offer transparency on financial activity and other connections between people with power. This package I made simplifies the experience interacting with LittleSis API for Python users.
