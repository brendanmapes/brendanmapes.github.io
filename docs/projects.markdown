#### Machine learning
* My <a href="https://github.com/brendanmapes/brendanmapes.github.io/blob/976af98db52c8023cbc9bea254705973eaf6489c/docs/_pdfs/thesis.pdf">thesis</a> for the QMSS master's program at Columbia University, where I studied data science. I used multiple machine learning algorithms to predict spin vectors of pitched baseballs during MLB games, in order to learn about a newly discovered force acting on balls in flight, seam-shifted wake. There are some obvious mistakes, outlined by my advisor <a href="https://github.com/brendanmapes/brendanmapes.github.io/blob/a6dde11913c666319c79f4c571be37df3c0e736e/docs/_pdfs/comments%20(1).pdf">here</a>. One of these days I'll update accordingly and repost.

* A repo for a project where I applied machine learning for <a href="https://github.com/brendanmapes/ml4fg_final/blob/main/research_summary.pdf">functional genomics</a> research. In this project we aimed to improve the precision of cell type deconvolution methods, which estimate the proportions of different cell types within a sample of tissue. To do this we proposed introducting a more sophisticated definition of cell types during model training, with more detailed cell types encoded in hierarchical trees. 

#### Data visualization
* An <a href="https://www.communitiesspeakproject.com/boroughs">interactive map visualization</a> (that renders rather slowly) of issues facing New Yorkers that were surveyed by a research team I worked with during my time at Columbia, called Communties Speak. The majority of my work for this project was either data engineering or analysis, managing survey data intake through analysis and reporting. Unfortunately we had to use a gradient color palette for discrete, categorical variables on this one.

####  Data engineering
* A <a href="https://pypi.org/project/littlesis/">Python package</a> to help users interact with the database on LittleSis.org, which aims to offer transparency on financial activity and other connections between people with power. This package I made simplifies the experience interacting with LittleSis API for Python users.

#### Quantitative Social Science
* An <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCmwcU0fP28"> alternative proposal</a> for my master's thesis research, which I left behind in grad school because getting access to the necessary data was challenging.
