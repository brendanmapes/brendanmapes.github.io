Welcome to my site. It's a work in progress. 

I work at Public Policy Lab, a design research and service design consulting firm based in Brooklyn. 

In May 2023, I graduated from Columbia University with master's degrees in data science and social policy. 

On this site I've collected a sample of projects I've worked on and some stuff I've been reading.
