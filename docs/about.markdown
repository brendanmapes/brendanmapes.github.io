In 2023 I graduated from Columbia University with master's degrees in data science and social policy (an MA from  <a href="https://qmss.columbia.edu"> QMSS </a> and an MIA from <a href="https://www.sipa.columbia.edu/sipa-education/masters-programs/master-international-affairsSIPA"> SIPA</a>). I studied probability and statistics, as the foundation of emerging data science techniques, and how to apply those data science techniques, like data mining, machine learning, and AI, in a wide variety of fields.

Since graduation I've been working at <a href="https://www.publicpolicylab.org"> Public Policy Lab</a>, a civic innovation and design research firm that works primarily with government agencies to rethink how they deliver social services.
