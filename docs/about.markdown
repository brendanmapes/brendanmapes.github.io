In 2023 I graduated from Columbia University with master's degrees in data science and social policy (an MA from  <a href="https://qmss.columbia.edu"> QMSS </a> and an MIA from <a href="https://www.sipa.columbia.edu/sipa-education/masters-programs/master-international-affairsSIPA"> SIPA </a>. 
During my time at Columbia, I studied probability and statistics, as the foundation of emerging data science techniques, as well as how to apply those data science techniques, like data mining, machine learning, and AI, in a wide variety of fields.

As a dual master's degree candidate, I completed both a master's thesis for my data science degree and a capstone project for my social policy degree. For my thesis, I implemented a machine learning model to predict pitch movement in the MLB using publicly available in-game data on pitch rotation, to learn about a newly discovered physical force acting on baseballs in flight called seam-shifted wake. For my capstone project, I worked as a consultant for Booz Allen Hamilton, developing an AI risk management framework for their clients who use AI tech. After years of building and deploying ML models, I was already familiar with the risks associated with their use and well-suited to consider strategies for risk mitigation. 

Since graduation I've been working at Public Policy Lab, a civic innovation and design research firm that works primarily with government agencies to rethink how they deliver social services.
