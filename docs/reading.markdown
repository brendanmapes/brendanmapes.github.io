Here's some stuff I think is interesting. 

* An <a href= "https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/i-will-fucking-piledrive-you-if-you-mention-ai-again/">opinion piece</a> on generative AI that feels relevant lately (as of 9/2/2024). 

* A commentary on my favorite book, <a href= "https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/robert-pirsig-zen-art-motorcycle-maintenance-resonates-today-180975768"> Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance<a/>.
